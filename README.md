# rust-hwi

**NB: This is a temporary fork of https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/rust-hwi. The plan is the full rewrite from scratch not to depend and not to work with the command-line python `hwi` utility and use `libusb` directly from rust - with improved data types and error reporting.**

Here is the copy of the original README:

Rust wrapper for [HWI](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/).

## Prerequisites

Python 3 is required. The libraries and [udev rules](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/blob/master/hwilib/udev/README.md) for each device must also be installed. Some libraries will need to be installed

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev python3-dev
```

For Centos:
```
sudo yum -y install python3-devel libusbx-devel systemd-devel
```

For macOS:
```
brew install libusb
```

## Install

- Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/MagicalBitcoin/rust-hwi.git && cd rust-hwi
```

- Create a virtualenv:

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Install all the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tests

At the moment you'll need a HW plugged in to be able to run tests.

If you don't have a hardware wallet, you can try [coldcard simulator](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware).

To run tests you should:

- Install requirements and activate the virtualenv, as specified before
- Plug in a HW.
- `cargo test`

## Devices tested
| Device | Tested |
|:---:|:---:|
| Ledger Nano X | NO
| Ledger Nano S | YES
| Trezor One | NO
| Trezor Model T | YES
| Digital BitBox | NO
| KeepKey | NO
| Coldcard | YES
